# Calendar_Project

This is my final submission for the Module 5 Challenge. The point of this challenge was to complement already existing code to create a calendar that allows the user to input text data for the hours of a typical business day (9 A.M to 5 P.M). The challenge also asked the coder to find the current time of the user and separate the calendar into three different classes( past, future, and present). This is important because the challenge was set to allow the user to input text into the calendar only for future events. The challenge also required to reference CSS elements to reflect the aforementioned classes. To achieve the desired result the Moment library was used. The code consists of an array with relevant information( index identification, time, a text placeholder, etc.), functions, and conditional statements to get the information from the user, compare the time and categorize them into the aforementioned classes, and save the text data into local storage. A button was also created to facilitate this process. Some functions( descriptions of these are given in the screenshots) utilize the CSS elements provided to beautify the calendar.
